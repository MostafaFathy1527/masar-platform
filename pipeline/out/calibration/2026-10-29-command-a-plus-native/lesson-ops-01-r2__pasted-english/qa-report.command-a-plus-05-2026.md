# QA gate report — writing-a-shift-handover

**Result: FAIL**

Mean 4.50 over 8 scored criteria (threshold 4.0); lowest criterion 1 (floor 3).

Lesson levels: L1, L2.

> LLM rubric score, fresh-context judge, self-assessed — not human QA

| Criterion | Score | Note |
|---|---|---|
| objective alignment | 5 |  |
| level fidelity | 5 |  |
| worked example | 5 |  |
| knowledge check | 5 |  |
| scenario authenticity | 5 |  |
| bilingual quality | 1 ⚠ | Arabic text is largely a literal copy of English, following English word order and sounding machine-generated rather than natural Arabic. |
| concision | 5 |  |
| accessibility ip | 5 |  |

**Judge independence:**

> This judge is a different model family and a fresh context: it saw only the judge prompt, the rubric and the lesson. It did not direct the project and did not author anything in it. It is still a language model scoring a language model's output, so the label applies: not human QA.

**Below the floor:** bilingual_quality. A single unacceptable criterion fails the gate regardless of the mean.

Judge's summary:

> The lesson excels in objective alignment, level fidelity, worked-example quality, knowledge-check quality, scenario authenticity, concision, and accessibility, but the Arabic translation is literal and machine-like, scoring 1. Because a criterion falls below 3, the gate will fail regardless of the overall mean of 4.5. The bilingual quality is the primary area for improvement.

The pipeline retries once with this report appended to the prompt, then stops for a human decision.
