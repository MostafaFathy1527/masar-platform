**Judge independence:**

> This judge is a different model family and a fresh context: it saw only the judge prompt, the rubric and the lesson. It did not direct the project and did not author anything in it. It is still a language model scoring a language model's output, so the label applies: not human QA.

**Below the floor:** bilingual_quality. A single unacceptable criterion fails the gate regardless of the mean.

Judge's summary:

> Bilingual quality is 1 and level fidelity is 3. The gate fails because a criterion is below 3. Mean score is 4.25.

The pipeline retries once with this report appended to the prompt, then stops for a human decision.
