# STATUS

Update this file at the end of every session. It is the first thing the next session reads.

## Now
**Week 1 complete — every definition-of-done criterion met.** `masar.mostafafathy.com`
is live over HTTPS, CI is green, the database is migrated and verified, and a clean clone
reaches a running instance in 156 seconds.

**Week 2 is open.** The `LessonDoc` schema and block registry have landed; the renderer,
the depth page and `validate.py` are next.

**One production gap, not a DoD line:** environment variables are still unset on Vercel,
so `POST /api/demo` returns 500 in production. The landing page is static and unaffected.

Scope of record is the correction pass (section 0 of the authoritative plan, path in
`.local/DAY0.md`) — **v1.0 = 6 weeks / ~65 h**. `BUILD.md` sections 3 and 9 describe the
older 14-week plan and are superseded; treat them as v2 reference only.

## Week 1 against its definition of done

| Criterion | Status |
|---|---|
| `masar.mostafafathy.com` serves a bilingual placeholder over HTTPS | **Met.** Verified independently: `/` 307 to `/ar`, both locales 200 in ~0.26 s, `dir` correct, Arabic rendering, TLS valid. |
| `prisma migrate deploy` runs clean | **Met.** `migrate status` reports no drift and `migrate dev` reports "Already in sync" locally, and CI replays the migrations against a real Postgres on every push. |
| A clean clone reaches a running local instance in under 5 minutes on Windows | **Met — 156 s.** Clone 14 s, `npm install` 95 s, dev server serving `/ar` 47 s. The script copied `.env` in, so this measures machine time, not the developer pasting two values. |
| CI green | **Met.** All three jobs. |
| No employer name in tree or history | **Met.** Verified over every blob in the object database. |

## The migration, and a diagnosis I got wrong

**Correction.** An earlier version of this file said outbound TCP 5432 was blocked at the
network level. **That was wrong.** The port is reachable — three connections for three, in
about a second each. What actually happened: the first attempt hit a Neon endpoint that had
auto-suspended and timed out, an HTTP call then woke it, and TCP was never retried. A cold
start, not a firewall. The control test used at the time (HTTPS to a different, always-awake
host) never isolated the variable it claimed to.

The consequences are reverted: `@prisma/adapter-pg` is restored, the Neon-specific packages
are removed, and `HANDOVER.md` records the real cause. `prisma migrate dev` now runs locally
and reports "Already in sync".

What was done at the time, which still stands:

- the baseline was applied to Neon over the HTTP endpoint and recorded in
  `_prisma_migrations` with the correct checksum, so `migrate deploy` treats it as applied;
- the applied structure was read back and matched: 8 tables, 8 enums with the expected
  member counts, 9 foreign keys, 16 unique indexes;
- the check became a permanent CI job. `migrations` replays the committed migrations
  against a real Postgres service and asserts by exit code that they reproduce the
  datamodel and leave no drift after applying.

**Result: the offline baseline was correct.** The `migrations` job passes, so
`migrate diff --from-migrations` finds no difference against the datamodel and no drift
after `migrate deploy`. The offline method got nothing wrong on this schema — and that is
now checked on every push rather than trusted once.

## Next (Week 2)
Ships by Sunday: lesson renderer + block registry, L1 and L2 rendering, a `/depth` page
showing one lesson at all three depths, and `pipeline/validate.py`.

1. **Block components** — one per type in `components/blocks/`, plus a `<BlockRenderer>`
   switch driven by the discriminated union.
2. **Lesson player shell** — reading column, progress rail, depth switch L1/L2/L3.
3. **`/depth`** — the same lesson rendered at each depth, side by side. This is the page
   an L&D reader will actually judge the project on.
4. **`pipeline/validate.py`** — structural validation against the generated JSON Schema,
   plus the semantic rules the schema cannot express, plus the forbidden-code-set
   denylist (CPT/HCPCS/CDT, X12 remark shapes, DRG).
5. **Hand-author lesson 4** at L1 + L2, bilingual, as the locked golden reference.
6. Self-hosted OFL fonts — still a system stack.

## Done
- **Week 2 started.** `lib/schema/lesson.ts` — the LessonDoc schema and 12-type block
  registry against a 16-type cap, with the cross-field rules a human editor cannot
  enforce by eye. `content/schema/lesson.schema.json` is generated from it and
  cross-validated with Python's `jsonschema`; a drift test makes "regenerate after any
  change" mechanical.

- Repo, the project rules file, `BUILD.md` (sanitized), `LATER.md`.
- **Publish safety.** Forbidden terms in `.local/denylist.txt` with a 14-case fixture;
  `.gitleaks.toml` with committed shape-based rules naming no person or company, plus an
  11-case fixture; `.local/gate.sh` scans blob content in three modes; a `pre-push` hook
  delegates to it. History rebuilt as one clean commit; git identity pinned.
- **Scaffold.** Next.js 16 + TypeScript + Tailwind 4, npm scripts, vitest.
- **`SPEC.md` v0** — all fourteen client headings, written to the 6-week scope.
- **Database.** 7 models, baseline applied to Neon and verified in CI.
- **Auth.** NextAuth v5 credentials + JWT, bcrypt cost 12, no user enumeration.
- **One-click guest.** `POST /api/demo` creates a guest, signs them in, redirects to
  `?tour=1`; `GET` returns 405. Verified against the live database.
- **Bilingual RTL landing page.** `/` to `/ar`, `/en` mirrors, `dir` flips, Arabic renders.
- **CI** — typecheck, lint, tests, `prisma validate`, build, migration verification,
  full-history secret scan.
- `HANDOVER.md` with resolved versions, the clean-clone runbook, and **Known deviations**.

## Blocked / needs the owner
- [ ] **Environment variables on Vercel** — `DATABASE_URL` and `AUTH_SECRET`, scoped to
      all environments. Until then `POST /api/demo` returns 500 in production. The
      landing page is static and serves fine without them.
- [ ] **Add the personal Gmail as a Vercel team owner** — the mitigation recorded against
      the work-email deviation in `HANDOVER.md`. Until then that risk is live.
- [ ] Day 0 #3 — confirm the fictional entity names read as obviously invented (Week 2).
- [ ] Day 0 #4 — Stripe availability. Not a v1.0 gate; only affects what `SPEC.md` claims.

## Decisions log
| Date | Decision | Why |
|---|---|---|
| 2026-09-08 | Name: **Masār** | Vertical-neutral, licensable as a platform rather than one course brand. |
| 2026-09-08 | v1.0 cut to 6 weeks / ~65 h | The 14-week plan was about twice what one part-time person can ship. |
| 2026-09-08 | One simulation only (`claim_review`) | It is the hero moment; the others stay documented patterns. |
| 2026-09-09 | **Postgres (Neon), not Turso** | Ownership story is content in git + `pg_dump` + an export endpoint. |
| 2026-09-09 | **`create-next-app@latest`** | Instructed by the correction pass. Landed Next 16 / React 19 / Tailwind 4. |
| 2026-09-09 | **Prisma held at 7.10.0** | `latest` resolves to `8.0.0-rc.13`; an RC does not belong on the critical path. |
| 2026-09-09 | **Denylist moved to `.local/`, history rebuilt** | Terms were literals in a tracked file, and the private plan path was in commit 1. |
| 2026-09-09 | **`AGENTS.md` added** | `next dev` injects a managed block into the project rules file unless `AGENTS.md` exists. |
| 2026-09-09 | **Week-by-week migrations**, 7 models now | Builds nothing for features the cut lines may drop. |
| 2026-09-09 | ~~`@prisma/adapter-neon`~~ — **reverted to `adapter-pg`** | The blocked-port diagnosis was wrong: it was a Neon cold start. Retry before concluding anything about a network. |
| 2026-09-09 | **Vercel project needs `framework: "nextjs"`** | With `framework: null` the build is green and every route 404s. Recorded in `HANDOVER.md`; no build log shows it. |
| 2026-09-09 | **Deployment Protection off** | Deliberate for a public portfolio demo whose purpose is that a stranger can open the link. |
| 2026-09-09 | **12 block types, cap 16** | The plan caps the registry at 16; the headroom is deliberate and unallocated. |
| 2026-09-09 | **Vercel on the work-email account** | Deliberate, recorded exception to Day-0 #1; that account owns the apex domain. |
| 2026-09-09 | **gitleaks binary, not the action** | The action builds an invalid revision range on a root-commit push: zero bytes scanned, job fails anyway. |
